# What is this?
This is seq2seq chatbot implementation. Most credit goes to [1228337123](https://github.com/1228337123/tensorflow-seq2seq-chatbot) and [AvaisP](https://github.com/AvaisP/Neural_Conversation_Models). I'm just reimplmenting their work to have better understandings on seq2seq. This chat bot is optimized for Japanese. You may replace existing tokenizer with one for your language.

Main differences of my implementation are
- More comments
- Easy to understand input/output format for each processes

# Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.1.0

# How to run
1. Prepare train data.
    1. Put your train data as data/tweets.txt, the file consists of pairs of tweet and reply.
    1. Odd lines are tweets and even lines are corresponding replies.
    1. You can get the training data using [github.com/Marsan-Ma/twitter_scraper](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/twitter_scraper).
1. Process the training data and generate vocabulary file and some necessary files. Run following command then you'd see the files generated in generated/ directory.

    python data_processer.py
1. Train! Train may take a few hours to 1 day, and it never stops. Once you think it's ready, just Ctrl-C. Model parameters are saved in generated/ directory.

    python train.py

1. Talk to him!

    python predict.py

# Twitter Bot
By running twitter_listenr.py and twitter_replier.py, you can run this chatbot on twitter.


Here are some interesting conversations with him.

# Experimental
I'm experimenting with Reinforcement Learning approache. See [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation](https://github.com/higepon/tensorflow_seq2seq_chatbot/wiki/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Dialogue-Generation).

Note that we need pre-trained swapped model, which is trained with tweets and replies swapped.

## How to train and predict
````
# Create data set for normal training.
% python data_processer.py --use_small_data=1 --use_swapped_data=0

# Create data set for swapped model training.
% python data_processer.py --use_small_data=1 --use_swapped_data=1

# Train swapped model.
% python train.py --use_small_data=1 --use_swapped_data=1

# See if swapped model is working.
% python predict.py --use_small_data=1 --use_swapped_data=1

# Make the swapped non-trainable.

# Train normal model with rewards.
% python train.py --use_small_data=1 --use_rewards=1
